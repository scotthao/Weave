	 * This function will remove an immediate callback from one ILinkableObject or ICallbackCollection and add it to another.
	 * There is no option provided here to call the callback immediately because typically when this function is used, the
	 * current target is stored somewhere, and errors would easily arise if the callback was called before the current target
	 * variable was updated.  It would also be inconvenient to update the current target variable prior to calling this function.
	 * @param oldTarget The old target, which may be null.
	 * @param newTarget The new target, which may be null.
	 * @param relevantContext Corresponds to the relevantContext parameter of ICallbackCollection.addImmediateCallback().
	 * @param callback Corresponds to the callback parameter of ICallbackCollection.addImmediateCallback().
	 * @return A value of true if the new target is different from the old and the callback was juggled.
	 * @see weave.api.core.ICallbackCollection#addImmediateCallback()
